# version 1.03
This version contains mostly nothing, I am working on the base of the game. Then I will work on game mechanics and after that I will work on graphics.
- still working on character select screen
- Added Settings
- Added gliding for character movement so its harder to dodge attacks from enemies, changes based on difficulty.
- removed player image as it looked ugly, might change later for now its a box
- added a developer menu with a option to play without selecting your character
- walkspeed now changes how little you glide and your acceleration speed and your top speed.

# issues
I am still working on the character select menu, for now it is not working and you should go to settings > Turn Dev Mode On > Back To Menu > Dev > Play without character select.
- character select menu bugged
- enemys spawn on the player sometimes
- there is no weapons to fight the enemys
